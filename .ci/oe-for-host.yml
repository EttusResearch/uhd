# Description:
#
# Build openembedded (OE) package for host architecture (genericx86-64)
#
# The recipe to be built is specified by variable "Image"
# The package itself is built (step "build $(Image)") and also all runtime
# dependencies are built (step "build $(Image) with dependencies")
#
# For the recipes "uhd", "uhd-fpga-images" and "mpmd", the build is configured
# to use the source code from the $(Agent.BuildDirectory)/uhd directory. The
# code is checked out by this pipeline with the branch and version which
# triggered this pipeline.
#
# The pipeline generates an artifact named qemux86_64-ipks containing the IPKs.
