### Requirements

- [Xilinx Vivado Release Notes](https://www.xilinx.com/content/dam/xilinx/support/documents/sw_manuals/xilinx2021_1/ug973-vivado-release-notes-install-license.pdf)
- [Xilinx ISE Platform Requirements](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx14_7/irn.pdf)

## Build Environment Setup

### Download and Install Xilinx Tools

Download and install Xilinx Vivado or Xilinx ISE based on the target USRP.
- The recommended installation directory is `/opt/Xilinx/` for Linux and `C:\Xilinx` in Windows.
- Please check the Xilinx requirements for the FPGA technology used by your USRP device.
- You may need to acquire a synthesis and implementation license from Xilinx to build some USRP designs.
- You may need to acquire a simulation license from Xilinx to run some testbenches.

### Download and Install ModelSim (Optional)

If you prefer to use ModelSim, download and install Mentor ModelSim using the
link above.
- The recommended installation directory is `/opt/mentor/modelsim` for Linux and `C:\mentor\modelsim` in Windows
- Supported versions are PE, DE, SE, DE-64 and SE-64
- You may need to acquire a license from Mentor Graphics to run ModelSim

### Setting up build dependencies on Ubuntu

You can install all the dependencies through the package manager:

    sudo apt-get install python bash build-essential doxygen

Your actual command may differ.

### Setting up build dependencies on Fedora

You can install all the dependencies through the package manager:

    sudo yum -y install python bash make doxygen

Your actual command may differ.

### Setting up build dependencies on Windows (using Cygwin)

**NOTE**: Windows is only supported with Vivado. The build system does not support Xilinx ISE in Windows.

Download the latest version on [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html) (64-bit is preferred on a 64-bit OS)
and install it using [these instructions](http://x.cygwin.com/docs/ug/setup-cygwin-x-installing.html).
The following additional packages are also required and can be selected in the GUI installer

    python3 patch patchutils bash make gcc-core doxygen

## Build Instructions (Xilinx Vivado only)

### Makefile based Builder

- Navigate to `<repo>/fpga/usrp3/top/{project}` where `{project}` is:
  + `x300`: For USRP X300 and USRP X310
  + `e31x`: For USRP E310
  + `e320`: For USRP E320
  + `n3xx`: For USRP N300/N310/N320
  + `x400`: For USRP X410

- To add vivado to the PATH and to setup up the Ettus Xilinx build environment run
  + `source setupenv.sh` (If Vivado is installed in the default path /opt/Xilinx/Vivado) _OR_
  + `source setupenv.sh --vivado-path=<VIVADO_PATH>` (where VIVADO_PATH is a non-default installation path)

- To build a binary configuration bitstream run `make <target>`
  where the target is specific to each product. To get a list of supported targets run
  `make help`.

- The build output will be specific to the product and will be located in the
  `<repo>/fpga/usrp3/top/{project}/build` directory. Run `make help` for more information.

### Environment Utilities

The build environment also defines many ease-of-use utilities. Please use
the \subpage md_usrp3_vivado_env_utils "Vivado Utility Reference" page for
a list and usage information.

### Known Issues

#### N2rt13HDRTExceptionE in Vivado 2021.1

**Problem:**

A sporadic routing error has been observed when building an FPGA with Vivado 2021.1, which prevents a bitfile from being generated:

    ERROR: [Route 35-9] Router encountered a fatal exception of type 'N2rt13HDRTExceptionE' - 'Trying to tool lock on already tool locked arc
    ERROR: [Common 17-39] 'route_design' failed due to earlier errors.

Attempting to rebuild the FPGA on the same Git hash does not resolve the problem.

**Solution:**

Use a different Git hash or make a non-functional source code change to the HDL to rebuild the design.

According to [Xilinx Support](https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E00006zHvfcSAC/router-crashes-after-a-second-routedesign-call?language=en_US), this issue will be fixed in a future version of Vivado.

#### Error During cs_server Initialization in Vivado 2021.1

**Problem:**

When using the Vivado hardware manager (JTAG), the following error is observed:

    ERROR: [Labtools 27-3733] Error during cs_server initialization: Vivado<->cs_server version mismatch, cs_server: [2021.1], Vivado: [2021.1_AR76780].
      To remedy this error, terminate the cs_server exectuable, and relaunch with version 2021.1_AR76780.
    ERROR: [Common 17-39] 'connect_hw_server' failed due to earlier errors.

**Solution:**

This is a known issue in Vivado 2021.1. See [Xilinx AR76681](https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/76681)
for details.

Issue the following TCL command to disable the version check before attempting
to connect to the hardware:

    set_param labtools.override_cs_server_version_check 1

### X4x0 Targets and Outputs

#### Supported Targets

Unlike the USRP X310, the target types do not only describe the connector
configuration, but also the available master clock rates. For example, the FPGA
target type `X4_200` is configured for a 200 MHz analog bandwidth, and can
support a 245.76 MHz or 250 MHz master clock rate.

A more detailed description of the targets can be found at \ref x4xx_updating_fpga_types.
Run `make help` in the `<repo>/fpga/usrp3/top/x400/` directory to see
the complete list of targets available.

#### Outputs
- `build/usrp_<product>_fpga.bit` : Configuration bitstream with header
- `build/usrp_<product>_fpga.dts` : Device tree overlay
- `build/usrp_<product>_fpga.rpt` : System, utilization and timing summary report

### Additional Build Options

It is possible to make a target and specify additional options in the form `VAR=VALUE` in
the command. For example:

    $ make X310 GUI=1

The options available are described in the following subsections.

#### Xilinx Vivado Make Options

- `GUI=1` : Run the Vivado build in GUI mode instead of batch mode. After the build is complete, Vivado provides an option to save the fully configured project for customization
- `CHECK=1` : Run elaboration only to check HDL syntax
- `SYNTH=1` : Run synthesis only
- `TOP=<module>` : Specify an alternate top-level module for syntax checking

#### Xilinx ISE Make Options

- `PROJECT_ONLY=1` : Only create a Xilinx project for the specified target(s). Useful for use with the ISE GUI.
- `EXPORT_ONLY=1` :  Export build targets from a GUI build to the build directory. Requires the project in build-\*_\* to be built.
