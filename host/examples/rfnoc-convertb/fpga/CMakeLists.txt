# the rest of the FPGA/Verilog/VHDL/HDL files. Only list files that are required
# for synthesis, testbench-specific files do not get installed and thus do not
# have to be listed (it won't hurt, it will just clutter your share/ directory).
# Don't list the files in the block subdirectories, though, they will get added
# below.
