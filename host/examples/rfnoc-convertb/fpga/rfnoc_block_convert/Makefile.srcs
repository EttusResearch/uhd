# include testbenches!
# Make sure that the source files are nicely detectable by a regex. Best to put
# one on each line.
# The first argument to addprefix is the current path to this Makefile, so the
# path list is always absolute, regardless of from where we're including or
# calling this file. RFNOC_OOT_SRCS needs to be a simply expanded variable
# (not a recursively expanded variable), and we take care of that in the build
# infrastructure.
