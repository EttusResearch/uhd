.SH NAME
uhd_cal_tx_iq_balance \- Generate TX IQ Balance Calibration Table for a UHD Device
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Universal Software Radio Peripheral Hardware Drivers handle calibration
information. This application reduces TX IQ imbalance within the specified frequency
range using transmit leakage into the receive path. Remove all external hardware
from the RF antenna ports before using this application. This can take up to
several minutes with default settings.
.LP
NOTE: This application can only be used with the WBX, SBX, XCVR2450, and RFX daughterboards.
