.TH "uhd_usrp_probe" 1 "3.7.0" UHD "User Commands"
.SH NAME
uhd_usrp_probe \- USRP Hardware Driver Peripheral Report Utility
.SH DESCRIPTION
Report detailed information on UHD-supported Software Radio Peripherals
attached by USB, network, or embedded configuration.
.LP
The UHD package is the universal hardware driver for Ettus Research products. The goal
is to provide a host driver and API for current and future Ettus Research products.
Users will be able to use the UHD driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.
.LP
Details include unit names, revision numbers, and available sensors on all attached
USRP motherboards and daughterboards.

.SH IDENTIFYING USRP DEVICES
.sp
Devices are addressed through key/value string pairs.
These string pairs can be used to narrow down the search for a specific device or group of devices.
Most UHD utility applications and examples have a \-\-args parameter that takes a device address,
where the device address is expressed as a delimited string.
See the documentation in types/device_addr.hpp for reference.

Every device has several ways of identifying it on the host system.
.SS Identifying by hardware identifier
.sp

All USRP devices can be found through their hardware series identifier, which match to USRP
devices as follows:

Argument    |  Device

type=usrp1  |  USRP1

type=usrp2  |  USRP2, USRP N200, USRP N210

type=b100   |  USRP B100

type=b200   |  USRP B200, USRP B210

type=e3x0   |  USRP E310

type=x300   |  USRP X300, USRP X310


.SS Identifying by serial number

All USRP devices are given a unique serial number, which can be used to identify a device as follows:

serial=12345678

.SS Identifying by IP address

USRP2, USRP N200, USRP N210, USRP X300, and USRP X310 devices connected to the host machine can all be found through their
IP addresses, as follows:

addr=192.168.10.2

.SS Identifying by name

Users have the option of giving their USRP devices short names using the usrp_burn_mb_eeprom utility
in lib/uhd/utils. Devices that have been given a name can be identified as follows:

name=foo
