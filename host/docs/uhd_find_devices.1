.SH NAME
uhd_find_devices \- USRP Hardware Driver Discovery Utility
.SH DESCRIPTION
Find UHD-supporting Ettus Research products attached by USB,
network or embedded configuration.
.LP
The UHD package is the universal hardware driver for Ettus Research
products. The goal is to provide a host driver and API for
current and future Ettus Research products. Users will be able to use
the UHD driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.

.SH IDENTIFYING DEVICES
.sp
Devices are addressed through key/value string pairs.
These string pairs can be used to narrow down the search for a specific device or group of devices.
Most UHD utility applications and examples have a \-\-args parameter that takes a device address,
where the device address is expressed as a delimited string.
See the documentation in types/device_addr.hpp for reference.

Every device has several ways of identifying it on the host system.
.SS Identifying by hardware identifier
.sp

All Ettus Research devices can be found through their hardware series identifier, which match to
devices as follows:

Argument       |  Device

type=usrp1     |  USRP1

type=usrp2     |  USRP2, USRP N200, USRP N210

type=b100      |  USRP B100

type=b200      |  USRP B200, USRP B210

type=e3x0      |  USRP E310

type=x300      |  USRP X300, USRP X310

type=octoclock |  OctoClock

.SS Identifying by serial number

All Ettus Research devices are given a unique serial number, which can be used to identify a device as follows:

serial=12345678

.SS Identifying by IP address

USRP2, USRP N200, USRP N210, USRP X300, USRP X310, and OctoClock devices connected to the host machine can all be found through their
IP addresses, as follows:

addr=192.168.10.2

.SS Identifying by name

Users have the option of giving their devices short names using the usrp_burn_mb_eeprom and octoclock_burn_eeprom
utilities in lib/uhd/utils. Devices that have been given a name can be identified as follows:

name=foo
