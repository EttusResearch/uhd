Welcome to the USRP Hardware Driver (UHD) manual. Here, you will find information on how to use the devices and how to use the API to connect to them through your own software.

This manual is split into two parts: The device manual, and the UHD/API manual. The first part describes details of our devices, mainboards and daughterboards, as well as aspects of _using_ UHD.

The second is meant for developers writing UHD-based applications, and includes descriptions of the API, sorted by namespaces, classes and files.

Follow these links to get to the section of the manual you wish to consult, or use the browser in the left sidebar. A search bar is also available at the top right, but note that this only works on API components. For information on how to build and install UHD, go to the UHD web site (see below).
