\section install_win Installation on Windows

We provide UHD software installers for Windows users who do not wish
to install UHD from source.

\subsection install_win_libusb LibUSBx

All Windows installers are built with LibUSBx to enable USB3 support.
LibUSBx binaries are not part of the installer and must be installed
manually.

\subsection install_win_installer Installer Packages

Installer packages are built from release tags of the maint branch.

Please find the latest installer here: http://files.ettus.com/binaries/uhd/latest_release

Older installers of all previous releases can be downloaded from:
http://files.ettus.com/binaries/uhd/ (browse to the desired release).

\subsection install_win_post Post-Install Tasks

Install the MSVC Redistributable Package:

- Download <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022
">MSVC Redistributable Package</a>

\subsubsection install_libUSB Install libUSB

LibUSBx binaries need to be installed on your system if they aren’t
already present. You can download the latest version of libUSB from the
<a href="https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases">LibUSB GitHub releases page</a>.
Each release includes binaries built for various platforms and compiler
versions. It’s crucial that the LibUSB binary corresponds to the platform
and compiler version used for the UHD binaries. This detail is indicated
in the name of the installer executable;
for example, uhd_4.7.0.0-release_Win64_VS2017.exe indicates it was built
for the 64-bit Windows platform using the Visual Studio 2017 compiler suite.
Copy all files from the path \\VS20XX\\MSYY\\dll within the archive to the bin folder
of the UHD installation location (by default "C:\Program Files\UHD\bin").
VS20XX is the Visual Studio version that you find in the name of the UHD installer.
YY is the bitness of your Windows version (32 or 64).

To validate that LibUSB has been successfully installed,
run uhd_find_devices from the bin folder of your UHD installation.

If the program fails to locate the LibUSB binaries an error message is displayed.
This can happen for the following reasons:

1. You’ve copied an incorrect version.
2. The binaries are not in a searchable location for the UHD binaries.
3. A conflicting LibUSB binary installed on your system which is not compatible
   is detected first.

\subsubsection USB_based_device Installation of additional drivers to use USB-based USRPs

- Download and install Windows UHD USB Drivers: http://files.ettus.com/binaries/misc/erllc_uhd_winusb_driver.zip
- \ref transport_usb_installwin

\subsection install_win_source Building from source

You can build UHD software from source. There are two choices of compilers for Windows users:

- Microsoft Visual Studio Express.
  + Users can develop with the free version.
- MinGW
  + An alternative to using a Microsoft compiler.

Refer to \ref build_instructions_windows

\section install_linux Installation on Linux

\subsection install_linux_pkgmgr Using your package manager

Most distributions provide UHD as part of their package management.
On Debian and Ubuntu systems, this will install the base UHD library, all headers
and build-specific files, as well as utilities:

    sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host

On Fedora systems, an equivalent command would be:

    sudo yum install uhd uhd-devel

Live CD/DVD/USBs are not supported.

On other distributions, please refer to your package manager's documentation.

\subsection install_linux_ourbins Using binaries provided by Ettus Research

We provide UHD binary installers for Ubuntu and Fedora users for every stable release.
Typically, we will provide binaries for latest two LTS versions of Ubuntu, and for the
latest two versions of Fedora. Live CD/DVD/USBs are not supported.

The latest versions of these binaries can be downloaded from here: http://files.ettus.com/binaries/uhd_stable/latest_release/

\subsubsection install_linux_ourbins_ubuntu Ubuntu

Copy and paste these commands into your terminal. This will install UHD software as well as allow you to receive package updates.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ettusresearch/uhd
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host

\subsubsection install_linux_ourbins_fedora Fedora

\b Note: You might want to run the following command if you're updating repositories:

    yum clean metadata all

Create the file /etc/yum.repos.d/ettus.repo. Copy this into the file:

    [ettus-uhd-stable-repo]
    name=Ettus Research - UHD Stable $releasever-$basearchthon serial timeout
    baseurl=http://files.ettus.com/binaries/uhd/repo/uhd/fedora/$releasever/$basearch
    gpgcheck=0

Run the following commands:

    sudo yum --enablerepo='ettus-uhd-stable-repo' install uhd

\subsection install_linux_pybombs Using PyBOMBS

This is an automated way of installing UHD from source. See also \ref build_pybombs.

\section install_osx Installation on Mac OS X

\section install_osx_macports Via MacPorts

We recommend using MacPorts and actively support UHD development on OS X via this method.
Using MacPorts, the correct hardware device images are automatically installed for you,
and there are no post install tasks. With a single command, you can be up and running in short order.

If you do not already have MacPorts installed, you will need to install it first. Make sure to follow the MacPorts shell environment changes needed such that MacPorts installed executables are found before all others. These are the only changes to the shell environment needed to execute any MacPorts-installed executable. Setting any DYLD environment variable (e.g., DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) for general use is highly discouraged, because doing so, in our experience, leads to problems down the road that are very difficult to diagnose. OSX provides robust means for correcting DYLD-based issues even after dependencies are installed.

Once MacPorts is installed, UHD and all of its dependencies can be installed by executing

    sudo port install uhd

The latest developments in UHD can be installed via

    sudo port install uhd-devel

Please note that the uhd-devel port, while tested for basic compilation and functionality, is not a formal release and hence should be considered beta software which might contain bugs or major issues.
