 * The Multi-USRP device class:
 *
 * This class facilitates ease-of-use for most use-case scenarios.
 * The wrapper provides convenience functions to tune the devices,
 * set the dboard gains, antennas, filters, and other properties.
 * This class can be used to interface with a single USRP with
 * one or more channels, or multiple USRPs in a homogeneous setup.
 * All members take an optional parameter for board number or channel number.
 * In the single device, single channel case, these parameters can be unspecified.
 *
 * When using a single device with multiple channels:
 *  - Channel mapping is determined by the frontend specifications
 *  - All channels share a common RX sample rate
 *  - All channels share a common TX sample rate
 *
 * When using multiple devices in a configuration:
 *  - Channel mapping is determined by the device address arguments
 *  - All boards share a common RX sample rate
 *  - All boards share a common TX sample rate
 *  - All boards share a common RX frontend specification size
 *  - All boards share a common TX frontend specification size
 *  - All boards must have synchronized times (see the set_time_*() calls)
 *
 * Example to setup channel mapping for multiple devices:
 * <pre>
 *
 * //create a multi_usrp with two boards in the configuration
 * device_addr_t dev_addr;
 * dev_addr["addr0"] = "192.168.10.2"
 * dev_addr["addr1"] = "192.168.10.3";
 * multi_usrp::sptr dev = multi_usrp::make(dev_addr);
 *
 * //set the board on 10.2 to use the A RX frontend (RX channel 0)
 * dev->set_rx_subdev_spec("A:A", 0);
 *
 * //set the board on 10.3 to use the B RX frontend (RX channel 1)
 * dev->set_rx_subdev_spec("A:B", 1);
 *
 * //set both boards to use the AB TX frontend (TX channels 0 and 1)
 * dev->set_tx_subdev_spec("A:AB", multi_usrp::ALL_MBOARDS);
 *
 * //now that all the channels are mapped, continue with configuration...
 *
 * </pre>

     * slightly differently when using this API vs. using the
     * radio_control::set_gpio_attr() API. For backward-compatibility reasons,

     * although the aforementioned devices have separate GPIO banks for each
     * radio. This API thus allows appending the slot name (typically "A" or "B")
     * to the GPIO bank to differentiate between radios. The following example
     * shows the difference between the RFNoC and multi_usrp APIs on a USRP N310:
     * ~~~{.py}
     * my_usrp = uhd.usrp.MultiUSRP("type=n3xx")
     * print(my_usrp.get_gpio_banks()) # Will print: FP0A, FP0B
     * # Now set all pins to GPIO for Radio 1 (note the 'B' in 'FP0B'):
     * my_usrp.set_gpio_attr("FP0B", "CTRL", 0x000)
     * # For backwards compatibility, you can omit the 'A', but that will default
     * # to radio 0. The following lines thus do the same:
     * my_usrp.set_gpio_attr("FP0", "CTRL", 0x000)
     * my_usrp.set_gpio_attr("FP0A", "CTRL", 0x000)
     * ### This is how you do the same thing with RFNoC API:
     * print(my_usrp.get_radio_control(0).get_gpio_banks()) # Will print: FP0
     * print(my_usrp.get_radio_control(1).get_gpio_banks()) # Will print: FP0
     * # Note how the radio controller only has a single bank!
     * # When accessing the radio directly, we thus can't specify any other bank
     * # than FP0:
     * my_usrp.get_radio_control(1).set_gpio_attr("FP0", "CTRL", 0x000)
     * ~~~
     *
     * The \p mask argument can be used to apply \p value only to select pins,
     * and retain the existing value on the rest. Because of this feature, this
     * API call will incur two register transactions (one read, one write).
