/*!
 * A templated property interface for holding the state
 * associated with a property in a uhd::property_tree
 * and registering callbacks when that value changes.
 *
 * A property is defined to have two separate vales:
 * - Desired value: Value requested by the user
 * - Coerced value: Value that was actually possible
 *                  given HW and other requirements
 *
 * By default, the desired and coerced values are
 * identical as long as the property is not coerced.
 * A property can be coerced in two way:
 * 1. Using a coercer: A callback function that takes
 *    in a desired value and produces a coerced value.
 *    A property must have *exactly one* coercer.
 * 2. Manual coercion: Manually calling the set_coerced
 *    API fnction to coerce the value of the propery. In
 *    order to use manual coercion, the propery must be
 *    created with the MANUAL_COERCE mode.
 * If the coerce mode for a property is AUTO_COERCE then
 * it always has a coercer. If the set_coercer API is
 * never used, then the default coercer is used which
 * simply set the coerced value to the desired value.
 *
 * It is possible to get notified every time the desired
 * or coerced values of a property potentially change
 * using subscriber callbacks. Every property can have
 * zero or more desired and coerced subscribers.
 *
 * If storing the property readback state in software is
 * not appropriate (for example if it needs to be queried
 * from hardware) then it is possible to use a publisher
 * callback to get the value of the property. Calling
 * get on the property will always call the publisher and
 * the cached desired and coerced values are updated only
 * using set* calls. A preprty must have *at most one*
 * publisher. It is legal to have both a coercer
 * and publisher for a property but the only way to access
 * the desired and coerced values in that case would be by
 * notification using the desired and coerced subscribers.
 * Publishers are useful for creating read-only properties.
 *
 * Requirements for the template type T:
 * - T must have a copy constructor
 * - T must have an assignment operator
