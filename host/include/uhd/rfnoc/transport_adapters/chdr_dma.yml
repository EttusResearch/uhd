# This is the description of the DMA transport adapter, which directly connects
# the PL to the PS. The DMA engine itself is not part of the image core (it is
# always instantiated), so the transport is mostly a passthrough.

# This is the name of the (System-)Verilog module that will be instantiated
module_name: rfnoc_ta_chdr_dma

# Same as RFNoC blocks, we list the rfnoc_chdr clock, which is required and
# will always be connected automatically by the image builder.
