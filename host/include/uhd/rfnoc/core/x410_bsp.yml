    message: |
      The CHDR DMA is not connected,
      which means the embedded processor will not be able to open a UHD connection
      to the FPGA, nor will UHD communication over the RJ45 port work!
      To fix this, add a CHDR DMA transport adapter to the image core,
      and connect it to the corresponding IO ports:
      transport_adapters:
        dma:
          block_desc : 'chdr_dma.yml'
      connections:
        - {srcblk: dma,       srcport: chdr_dma_s, dstblk: _device_, dstport: chdr_dma_s}
        - {srcblk: _device_,  srcport: chdr_dma_m, dstblk: dma,      dstport: chdr_dma_m}
    severity: warning
  - condition: ${any(c['dstblk'] == "_device_" and c['dstport'] == "qsfp0" for c in config.connections) or any(c['dstblk'] == "_device_" and c['dstport'] == "qsfp1" for c in config.connections)}
    message: |
      Neither the QSFP0 nor QSFP1 ports are connected in the design. No
      communication over the QSFP ports will be possible with this bitfile.
      For example, to add a 100 GbE connection to QSFP0, add these lines:
