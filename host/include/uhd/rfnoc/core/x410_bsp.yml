# This describes available clocks from the BSP. Note that the indices are not
# arbitrary: Making clock info fully discoverable through registers would be
# more complicated than is worth it, so we hard-code the indices for some of the
# clocks. The control and default CHDR clocks are 0/1, followed by the radio
# clocks.
# Note that indices can also be dynamically allocated.
