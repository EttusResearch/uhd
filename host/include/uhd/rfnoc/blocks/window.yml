description: |
  The Window Block is a windowing block that is intended to be
  used with the FFT block. The block can be configured with coefficients,
  by which the samples in each input packet are multiplied before beginning
  output. The first sample of the first packet is multiplied by the
  first coefficient, the second sample is multiplied by the second
  coefficient, and so on.
