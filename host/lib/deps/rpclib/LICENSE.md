# License terms for humans

The following is a friendly explanation of the license. For legal purposes, the license below is
what matters, not this explanation.

This library is licensed under the *MIT license*. What this means for you:

  * You can use it freely in any form you want
  * You can sell software that uses it
  * You can sell modified versions of it
  * You **do not** need to apply the same license to software you develop with it
  * You **do not** need to apply the same license for modified versions
  * You **do not** have to attribute usage.

## But

  * There is no guarantee. None. At all. I'm also not obligated to work on a particular issue, or
    even respond to them (though I'll do my best, I promise).

## Also

This is not part of the license, but if you want to be nice and give back, please let me know
if you are using the library for anything serious. You can also let the world know that you are using it.
