uhd (3.9.5-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  - B200: Update DSPs after changing tick rate
  - X300: Added option to disable ADC self test, prevent DAC from
    underrunning
  - UBX: Fixed noise issues, reduced power consumption/heat, added codes for
    upcoming board revisions, force RX LNAs on (reduces rx settling time)
  - WBX: Fixed rev2 and rev3 boards on X300
  - Utils/Examples: Cleaned up query_gpsdo_sensors, test_dboard_coercion,
  - Manual: Minor fixes and updates
  - CMake: Fix lib64 detection, better platform detection, Doxygen may use shorter
    filenames
  - Octoclock: GPSDO-related fixes, sequence number consistency fixes, UART
    fixes (off-by-one errors). uhd_usrp_probe will pick up an OC now,
    added Wireshark dissector for OC packets
