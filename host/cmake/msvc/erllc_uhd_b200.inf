;
; To customize this inf file for your own device
;
; 1. Change "DeviceName" with the name you want your device to appear with 
;    on your system.
;
; 2. Change "VendorID" and "ProductID" according to those of your device. 
;    If your device is plugged in, you can retrieve these values through the 
;    Device Manager (regardless of whether the driver is installed or not).
;
; 3. Change "DeviceGUID" to a value that is unique on your system. For more 
;    information and tools to help you generate your own GUIDs, see 
;    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier.
;
; 4. Change "DeviceClassGUID" to reflect your USB Device Class. 
;    The following Device Classes are listed for reference:
;    {745a17a0-74d3-11d0-b6fe-00a0c90f57da} : HID device
;    {78a1c341-4539-11d3-b88d-00c04fad5171} : Generic WinUSB device
;
; 5. (Optional) Change the "Date" string.
;
; Note 1: if you need to create a matching cat file for this inf, you can use
; the inf2cat utility from the WinDDK, with the the following command:
; inf2cat /driver:"path_to_your inf" /os:7_X86,7_X64,Vista_X86,Vista_X64

; The Include and Needs directives in the USB_Install section are required for 
; installing WinUSB on Windows Vista systems. Windows XP systems ignore these 
; directives. These directives should not be modified.
[USB_Install]
Include=winusb.inf
Needs=WINUSB.NT

; The Include directive in the USB_Install.Services section includes the system-
; supplied INF for WinUSB. This INF is installed by the WinUSB co-installer if 
; it is not already on the target system. The AddService directive specifies 
; WinUsb.sys as the device�s function driver. These directives should not be 
; modified.
[USB_Install.Services]
Include=winusb.inf
Needs=WINUSB.NT.Services

; The KmdfService directive installs WinUsb.sys as a kernel-mode service. The 
; referenced WinUSB_Install section specifies the KMDF library version. 
; Usually, the version can be derived from the WdfCoInstallerxxyyy.dll with 
; xx = major, yyy = minor

; USB_Install.HW is the key section in the INF. It specifies the device 
; interface globally unique identifier (GUID) for your device. The AddReg 
; directive puts the interface GUID in a standard registry value. When 
; WinUsb.sys is loaded as the device�s function driver, it reads the registry
; value and uses the specified GUID to represent the device interface. You 
; should replace the GUID in this example with one that you create specifically
; for your device. If the protocols for the device change, you should create a
; new device interface GUID.
